## 0.3.0.0 - Unreleased
### Added
- CHANGELOG.md and README.md
- Support for generating throw-away TLS certificates, possibly changing the default to HTTPS.

### Changed
- I will probably be removing the \-\-allow\-http option as it doesn't appear to work anyway,
and it's not really desirable.

## 0.2.0.0 - 2014-12-06
### Added
- Support for uploading files.  This includes overwriting existing files.

## 0.1.0.0 - 2014-11-11

a directory tree.
